# Components

This file contains documentation about each of the components in the repository.

## `app/components/create-exercise/`
The `app/components/create-exercise/` directory is used to create a component for the Create Exercise screen. It uses the `DropdownComponent` and the `UploadVideo` component to create fields.
The component first asks the user for an exercise name using a TextInput box. The component then asks the user for an exercise type using the `DropdownComponent`. The component then asks the user for any exercise notes using a multi-line TextInput box. The component then allows the user to input a video showing how the exercise is performed. At the bottom of this component, there is an Add Exercise button

# Documentation

This file contains general documentation about each file in the repository. Some files may contain detailed documentation in a different file in this directory.

## `.github/workflows/linting.yml`
The `.github/workflows/linting.yml` file is used to ensure the repository linting is correct before committing any files and before making any pull requests.

## `.husky/pre-commit`
The `.husky/pre-commit` file ensures that each file contains the correct linting before committing. If a file does not contain the correct linting, the commit will fail.
